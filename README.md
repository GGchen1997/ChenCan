Bachelor of Computer Science, Information Security Department 2015 onwards

										
- *GPA: 3.93*
- *Rankings: 3/53* 
- *CET 6: 550*

###PRACTICE EXPERIENCE
####Electric Design:

    Drawing board with touch-sensitive screens & Cube light:
    	Based on STM32F103R8T6, we realized single point positioning , handwritten drawing and Greedy Snake on a 4-wire  resistive analog touch screen.       
        Furthermore, we integrated gestures into the Cube light using a MPU6050 chip and implemented Greedy Snake of 3D version etc. I was  responsible  for most of the game development.

Deep Learning(Image compression based on Pytorch) 
 
	

    Summary:  To implement an end-to-end optimized image compression method combined with Vector Quantization

    Knowledge Base: 
    [1] Johannes Ballé, Valero Laparra, and Eero P Simoncelli. End-to-end optimized image compression.arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01704, 2016.
    [2]Eirikur Agustsson,Fabian Mentzer,Michael Tschannen,Lukas Cavigelli.Soft-to-Hard Vector Quantization for End-to-End Learning Compressible Representations.arXiv:1704.00648, 2017.   
                  
    Dataset: Our lab selected texture-rich images from flicker, cropped them and made the dataset. 
    
	Model: Make a few reasonable adjustments of the network in [1], and replace  Scalar Quantization in [1] with Vector Quantization in [2].
	
	Present Achievement: 0.48bpp:PSNR = 18.73db，SSIM =0.70，MSSSIM = 0.80;The results now are not satisfactory,but I am still working on it.
	
	Main Problems:  The hyperparameters in the model are not properly set; The memory resources in the cluster is limited, so some updating methods of model parameters introduced by the author can not be realized and have to be simplified a lot; The details of the combination of the two papers may not be handled properly, thus leading a bad expression of the model.
    Solutions: Try a larger hyperparameters set; Improve some updating methods of model parameters; May add a layer of convolution to enhance expressivity of the model.
